## About
M. K. Parit is a researcher in AMO (Atomic, Molecular, and Optical) Physics. His PhD thesis focused on dipolar quantum gases of erbium atoms, where he explored superradiance across the BEC-droplet transition. He has significant experience working with the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (eGPE) to study dipolar atomic systems. Additionally, he has worked on one-dimensional quantum spin chains, investigating entanglement and other quantum correlations. 

He completed his PhD in Physics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong. Before that, he earned a 5 Year BS-MS dual degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, a premier institute for basic sciences in India.
