## About me ðŸ‘‹
M. K. Parit is a researcher in AMO Physics.  His PhD thesis research focuses on dipolar quantum gases of erbium atoms, where he explored the superradiance across the BEC-droplet transition. He has significant experience working on the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (eGPE) to study dipolar atoms. He has also experience working on the 1D quantum spin chains, to quantify the entanglement and other quantum correlations.

He completed his PhD in Physics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong. Before this, I earned a 5 Year BS-MS Dual Degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science and Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, a premier institute for Basic Sciences in India.
